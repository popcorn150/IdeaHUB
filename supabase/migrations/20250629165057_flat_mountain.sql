/*
  # Create avatars storage bucket

  1. Storage Setup
    - Create `avatars` bucket for user profile pictures
    - Set bucket to be publicly accessible for reading
    - Configure appropriate policies for authenticated users

  2. Security
    - Users can upload their own avatars
    - Anyone can view avatars (public read access)
    - Users can only update/delete their own avatars
